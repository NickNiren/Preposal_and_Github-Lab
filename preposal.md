## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

Endless arcade game where user controls a car at the center of the screen and has to avoid hazards (trees, rocks, other moving cars). Difficulty increases overtime. Score is based on how long the player survives. Maybe power-ups?
The hope is to have other AI controled cars which can react to the player's driving as well as the randomly generated infinite terrain.
